Changes in clustComp 1.5.1
==========================

  o A new feature is added to flatVShier(); if the expanded 
version of the dendrogram is plotted, a coloured bar on the
right hand side displays how genes are distributed across
the flat clusters.

  o New arguments ‘bar1.col’ and ‘bar2.col’ in flatVShier()
allow tuning the coloured bars when the expanded dendrogram 
is plotted.

  o Argument ‘weights’ in flatVSflat() is replaced by 
‘flat1’ and ‘flat2’ for analogy with flatVShier().

  o New argument ‘greedy’ in flatVSflat() allows displaying
the one-to-one mapping between superclusters as in 
flatVShier() after finding the best layout for the bi-graph.

  o New argument ‘greedy.colours’ allows setting up the 
visualisation of the mapping between superclusters, as in
flatVShier().

  o The visualisation of superclusters in SCmapping() 
includes new labels with their sizes.

  o Internal function drawTreeGraph() includes new arguments
‘flat.obj’, ‘bar1.col’ and ‘bar2.col’ to display the second
coloured bar and control the colours.


Changes in clustComp 1.2.0
==========================

  o Added new arguments ‘expression’, ‘layout’ and ‘ramp’ 
to flatVShier(), to provide more flexibility to the plot 
layout.

NEW FEATURE:

  o The expanded version of the flatVShier() function allows 
adding the heatmap of the data, ordered according to the 
resulting hierarchical tree.

BUG FIX

  o Fix bug in plotting the flatVSflat comparison.


Changes in clustComp 1.0.0
==========================

  o Release of the package.
